**Staff'd is a desktop application to help managers manage their staffs.** Staffâ€™d helps F&B managers manage details and schedules of their staff. 
It is optimized for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
